## About
Terraria style game being developed in c++.
Development is mostly one person (me), but there might be some contributions
done by other people.

## Libraries-Used
For graphics, player input, audio, etc the Raylib game framework is being used,
which can be found at raylib.com. Raylib, raymath, and other raylib libraries are
created by Raysan5 [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). For world generation,
a noise library called FastNoiseLite is used, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite).
